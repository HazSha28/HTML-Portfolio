    <h1>About me</h1>
<p>"Hi, I'm Ayishathul Hazeena, a third-year Computer Science and Business Systems student at KIT – Kalaignarkarunanidhi Institute of Technology.<br> I’m passionate about both technology and management, and I’ve discovered a strong synergy between the two through my journey in web development.<br> Currently, I’m working on a project titled Hadith Master, which integrates cutting-edge AI technologies. In addition, I’ve built several smaller projects to deepen my understanding of web development fundamentals.<br>

As an active Toastmasters member, I’ve developed effective communication and public speaking skills, allowing me to express my ideas with clarity and confidence.<br> I’ve participated in two 24-hour hackathons at my college and competed in several intercollegiate technical events, and have placed in the top 14th position for problem-solving challenges.<br>

An idea I live by: 'When passion drives effort, perfection naturally follows — I believe in giving my best when I’m truly interested.'"</p>
